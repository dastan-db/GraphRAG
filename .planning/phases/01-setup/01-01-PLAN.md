Create Databricks Solution Accelerator structure: shared config in src/config.py
(catalog, schema, LLM endpoints, Bible book list), intro notebook, data prep
notebook that loads KJV Bible text from GitHub into a Delta verses table,
RUNME.py that creates a multi-task Databricks workflow, pyproject.toml with
dependencies, and databricks.yml for Asset Bundle deployment.
</action>
<verify>Notebook 00 displays config. Notebook 01 creates and populates the verses table. RUNME.py creates a Databricks job with correct task dependencies.</verify>
<done>SA scaffold exists; verses table populated with 5 Bible books; RUNME.py creates workflow job.</done>
</task>

<!-- Original plan referenced Neo4j + Docker + Tree-sitter + graphrag/ package.
     Pivoted to Delta tables + Databricks-native SA format early in Phase 01.
     This plan updated 2026-02-28 to reflect what was actually built. -->
