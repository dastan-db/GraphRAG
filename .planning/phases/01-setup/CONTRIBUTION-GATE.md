# Phase 01 Contribution Gate

**Phase:** Solution Accelerator (full loop)
**Date:** 2026-02-27 (backfilled)

## Gate Questions (all must be YES to proceed)

1. **Mission alignment:** Does this phase advance a PRFAQ outcome?
   - [x] YES — Advances: All five PRFAQ outcomes. Phase 01 builds the complete pipeline from ingestion through agent through evaluation — the foundation for auditable, traceable, reproducible AI reasoning.

2. **Requirements delivery:** Which requirements does this phase deliver?
   - Delivers: R1.1, R1.2, R1.3, R1.4, R1.5, R1.6, R1.7, R1.8, R1.9

3. **Platform leverage:** Does this demonstrate something Databricks does uniquely well?
   - [x] YES — Leverages: Unity Catalog (Delta tables as graph backend), Foundation Model API (ai_query for extraction), MLflow (model logging + serving), Spark SQL (graph traversal tools), Databricks Workflows (RUNME.py).

4. **Feasibility:** Can we complete this in the estimated time?
   - [x] YES — Estimate: 1-2 weeks. Actual: completed within estimate despite architecture pivot.

5. **Learning continuity:** Have we read the Phase N-1 Retrospective?
   - [x] N/A — First phase.

6. **Target fidelity:** What fidelity level are we building to?
   - [x] **Level 2 (Shape It):** Extracting to src/ modules, clean interfaces, tested. Ship-ready for SA.
   - Components: All pipeline components at Level 2 (notebooks orchestrate, reusable code in src/).

## Decision
**Approved:** YES (retroactive)
