## Gate Questions (all must be YES to proceed)

1. **Mission alignment:** Does this phase advance a PRFAQ outcome?
   - [x] YES — Advances: "Auditable, traceable, reproducible reasoning" (PRFAQ critical benefit #3). Every answer includes provenance. Hallucinations are structurally detected.

2. **Requirements delivery:** Which requirements does this phase deliver?
   - Delivers: R1.10, R1.11, R1.12, R1.13, R1.14

3. **Platform leverage:** Does this demonstrate something Databricks does uniquely well?
   - [x] YES — Leverages: MLflow custom scorers for governance evaluation, Foundation Model API for structured output, MLflow tracing for full reasoning chain audit.

4. **Feasibility:** Can we complete this in the estimated time?
   - [x] YES — Estimate: 1-2 days. Actual: completed within estimate.

5. **Learning continuity:** Have we read the Phase 01 Retrospective?
   - [x] N/A — Phase 01 retrospective was not written at the time (process debt).

6. **Target fidelity:** What fidelity level are we building to?
   - [x] **Level 2 (Shape It):** Extracting to src/ modules, clean interfaces, tested. Ship-ready for SA.
   - Components: Provenance output (L2 in agent.py), governance scorers (L2 in evaluation.py), reproducibility test (L2 in evaluation.py)

## Decision
**Approved:** YES (retroactive)
