# GraphRAG — Project context

> **End in mind:** See [PRFAQ.md](PRFAQ.md) for the Working Backwards artifact — the customer, the problem, the press release, and the FAQ that define what we are building and why. Requirements and roadmap are derived from it.

## Vision

GraphRAG: build a retrieval-augmented system that uses a knowledge graph (entities + relationships) to improve RAG quality and reasoning over documents.

## Scope (current milestone)

- Purpose: Enable structured, graph-based context for LLM queries.
- Stack: To be defined during phases (Python/Databricks ecosystem preferred; see existing .cursor/skills).
- Constraints: Keep plans atomic, context-sized; use .planning/ as single source of truth.

## Out of scope (this milestone)

- Full product UI, multi-tenant auth, and production ops are out of scope until later milestones.
